# Decorators : In Python, decorators are flexible way to modify or extend behavior of functions or methods, without changing their actual code.


# Problem 1: Timing Function Execution
# Problem 2: Debugging Function Calls
# Problem 3: Cache Return Values

# A decorator is essentially a function that takes another function as an argument and returns a new function with enhanced functionality.
# Decorators are often used in scenarios such as logging, authentication and memorization, allowing us to add additional functionality to existing functions or methods in a clean, reusable way.
